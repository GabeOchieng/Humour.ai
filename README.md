# Humour.ai

I have seen a lot of people do cool projects in Computer Vision (the more hyped one) but hardly I have ever seen something good in NLP. After learning about transformers, I thought I should do something in NLP. I have fine tuned GPT-2 with a language model head on short jokes scrapped from reddit.

**Humor.ai tries to complete the sentences in a humourous way given some input words**

I tested my model on unseen words and sentences and got some really cool and surprising results

The first one is really hilarious given the fact that model doesn't know my name ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Language Model that can make you Laugh
